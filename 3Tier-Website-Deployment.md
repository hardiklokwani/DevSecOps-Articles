# 🚀 Explore the World with Wanderlust: A 3-Tier MERN Stack Adventure! ∞

Are you ready to join me on an exhilarating journey into the world of 3-tier MERN stack development? 🌍✈️

## Introducing Wanderlust

Wanderlust is more than just a simple 3-tier MERN stack travel blog website 🚀 It's a project aimed at helping people contribute to open source, upskill in React, and master Git.

With Wanderlust, we're not just building a travel blog; we're building a community of passionate developers who are eager to learn and grow together.

Join us on this exciting journey and let's explore the world of MERN development together! 🌍✈️

## Project Details

### AWS Setup
To lay the foundation for Wanderlust, we set up camp in the cloud with Amazon Web Services (AWS). We created a virtual server instance on AWS and configured it to host our application.

### Backend Setup
Our journey began by developing the backend of our application. We built it using Node.js and MongoDB, two powerful technologies that allowed us to create a robust and scalable backend that could handle all of our data storage needs.

### Frontend Setup
With the backend in place, we turned our attention to the frontend of our application. We wanted to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that would allow our users to easily document their adventures and share them with the world.

### Docker Setup
To ensure that our application could run smoothly in any environment, we used Docker to containerize it. Docker allows us to package our application and all of its dependencies into a single, lightweight container that can be easily deployed anywhere.

### Jenkins Setup
To automate our development workflow, we used Jenkins as our continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool. Jenkins allows us to automatically build, test, and deploy our application whenever we make changes to the codebase.

### CI/CD Pipeline
Our CI/CD pipeline is the heart of our development process. It consists of several stages:

1. **Clone Code from GitHub**: We start by pulling the latest version of our code from our GitHub repository.

2. **Code Quality Analysis**: Next, we use SonarQube to analyze the quality of our code and identify any potential issues or vulnerabilities.

3. **Dependency Check**: We use OWASP Dependency-check to scan our code for any known security vulnerabilities in our dependencies.

4. **Quality Gate Scan**: Once our code has passed all of our quality checks, we use SonarQube to ensure that it meets our quality standards.

5. **Security Scan**: We use Trivy to scan our Docker images for any known security vulnerabilities.

6. **Deployment**: Finally, we use Docker Compose to deploy our application to our production environment.

## Conclusion

The Wanderlust project was not just a journey into 3-tier MERN stack development; it was an adventure! We've created a powerful and flexible platform that allows users to document their adventures and share them with the world.
